# What is this?

I took a day to try to learn a bit of React and decided to try to make a react version of a Zendesk app I've built. It isn't nearly finished, but I want to have the code somewhere as I had to make a few changes to the webpack configuration to get things up and running.

The original scaffolding from Zendesk is here: https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffold/tree/from-scratch
